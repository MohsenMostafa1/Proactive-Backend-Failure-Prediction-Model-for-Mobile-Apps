# Proactive-Backend-Failure-Prediction-Model-for-Mobile-Apps
This model uses real-time metric analysis + hybrid ML to predict failures with lead time for mitigation.

Key Components:

    Data Layer

        Prometheus: Collects real-time metrics (CPU, memory, latency)

        Kafka: Stream processing pipeline (handles 10K+ events/sec)

        Redis: Sliding window buffer (last 10 samples)

    Model Layer

        Isolation Forest: Detects anomalous metric spikes

            Trained on 50K samples with 10% contamination

            Features: CPU, memory, error rate deltas

        LSTM Network: Temporal pattern recognition

            Architecture: 2 LSTM layers (64/32 units) + Dropout

            Input: 10-step sequences (15-second intervals)

        Ensemble: Weighted average (0.4*Isolation + 0.6*LSTM)

    Operational Layer

        FastAPI: 50ms latency per prediction

        Circuit Breaker: Failsafe after 5 consecutive errors

        Evidently: Monitors feature drift (weekly retraining trigger)

    Action Layer

        Threshold-based alerts (0.7=Warning, 0.85=Critical)

        Automated scaling via Kubernetes HPA

        PagerDuty integration for SRE teams
